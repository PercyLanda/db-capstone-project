Coursera Database Engineering Capstone Project - October 2023

## Project Overview
This project is the capstone for the Coursera Database Engineering Professional Certificate. It demonstrates the application of SQL and database engineering principles to solve real-world problems.

## Project Objectives
- Design and implement a relational database for a restaurant management system (Little Lemon).
- Write SQL scripts for creating and managing database tables.
- Develop and optimize SQL queries for data analysis and reporting.
- Use stored procedures and functions to automate repetitive tasks.
- Visualize data using Tableau for insights and business decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: for database creation, manipulation, and querying.
- **MySQL**: as the database management system (DBMS).
- **Tableau**: for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: for executing SQL queries with MySQL connector.

## Project Contents
- **ER Diagrams**: Database design visualizations.
- **SQL Scripts**: For database creation, data insertion, and queries.
- **Stored Procedures**: Predefined routines for common operations.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Visual analysis of the restaurantâ€™s data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environments to execute SQL code.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the SQL scripts into a MySQL database.
3. Use the stored procedures and queries provided to interact with the database.
4. Open the Tableau files for data visualization.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more advanced queries for predictive analytics.
- Optimizing existing SQL queries for performance.
- Integrating the system with a web application for real-time data interaction.
